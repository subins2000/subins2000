<summary>Fish doesn't realize it</summary>
If humans are confined in a cell, they'll obviously try to get out of it or seek the world outside of it. A fish (aquarium fish to be exact) doesn't do anything. It just breathes and moves around. It doesn't have the thinking capability to know it's imprisoned (does it ?) nor do they think there's a world outside.

Meanwhile, dogs, cats & birds gets crazy when they're confined in a cage. They get triggered when they see hoomans walking outside it, making sounds to persuade you to open the cage. They know there's a world outside, cats to chase, dogs to irritate & a vast world to fly around. Freedom has a meaning to them.

Fish doesn't know or realize it.

<summary>Cats have a sad life</summary>
Stray cats always come around during lunch times looking for something to eat. They literally beg with their sweet voices, trying to get some sympathy, with the hope that they'll get something to eat. Throughout their life, they need to beg to live. Have they survived in the world till now by beggging ? Has begging turned out to be an innate part of their life ? The next generations will still beg, continuing what their forefathers did. Kittens grow up learning to be good beggars ? It has become intrinsic. That's sad.
