<summary>Plastic sand</summary>

Everywhere I go, I see plastic. Places told as true nature's beauty, if you look closely, you'll see a bit of plastic somewhere. But, this only happened in the last 40 years and is still happening to the point that plastic will be as normal as sand. Next generation kids would grow up thinking plastic as normal (would they play & eat plastic like how kids eat mud ?).

We're (GenZ) probably the last generation that saw rivers, lakes, beaches without any plastic in it. Next generation is not so lucky. To know this is still happening right at the time of writing this is sad.

The Challenger Deep (Mariana Trench) is the deepest part of the ocean where we haven't reached yet, oh we did ! Plastic floats at [the remotest place on Earth](https://youtu.be/PaErPyEnDvk).

When we made plastic, did we think of the long-term reprecussions of it ? Did we try to find an alternate or for the sake of cost and business, went along with it, knowing very well the destruction it can cause ? [The latter is the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clean_Room)

For short-term-profits, to be rich till we die, we screw our future generations. And they'll have to suffer and deal with it. I understand why [Greta is angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMrtLsQbaok), I am too.

<summary>Fish doesn't realize it</summary>

If humans are confined in a cell, they'll obviously try to get out of it or seek the world outside of it. A fish (aquarium fish to be exact) doesn't do anything. It just breathes and moves around. It doesn't have the thinking capability to know it's imprisoned (does it ?) nor do they think there's a world outside.

Meanwhile, dogs, cats & birds gets crazy when they're confined in a cage. They get triggered when they see hoomans walking outside it, making sounds to persuade you to open the cage. They know there's a world outside, cats to chase, dogs to irritate & a vast world to fly around. Freedom has a meaning to them.

Fish doesn't know or realize it.

<summary>Hooman companions</summary>

Of all the animals on Earth, there are only dogs and cats who we have the most companionship with. There are cows, goats too, but I mean organisms that is near to the size of a dog/cat. [Indian grey mongoose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_gray_mongoose) is cool, but they're very scared of humans. They stand up and stare at you, but I think they're cool. Snakes can't kill them, that's pretty savage.

A mother mongoose and their kids sometimes come in the backyard to find something to eat, but they're very scared of humans. They haven't developed the sound as cats do for begging, but they might in future, maybe. Were cats too savage like mongoose in the past ? Oh, [maybe](https://www.flickr.com/photos/damienbottura/2050971092/). Their cousin Tigers sure are !

Mongooses are not scared of snakes, but they're scared of humans. That tells someting eh ?

<summary>Cats have a sad life</summary>

Stray cats always come around during lunch times looking for something to eat. They literally beg with their sweet voices, trying to get some sympathy, with the hope that they'll get something to eat. Throughout their life, they need to beg to live. Have they survived in the world till now by beggging ?

Have begging turned out to be an innate part of their life ? The next generations will still beg, continuing what their forefathers did. Kittens grow up learning to be good beggars ? It has become intrinsic. That's sad.

2020 August 13 (This thought was triggered by the cat that comes to our house seeking food everyday. It gave 3 cute little kittens last week.)
