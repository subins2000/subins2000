<summary>Fish doesn't realize it</summary>

If humans are confined in a cell, they'll obviously try to get out of it or seek the world outside of it. A fish (aquarium fish to be exact) doesn't do anything. It just breathes and moves around. It doesn't have the thinking capability to know it's imprisoned (does it ?) nor do they think there's a world outside.

Meanwhile, dogs, cats & birds gets crazy when they're confined in a cage. They get triggered when they see hoomans walking outside it, making sounds to persuade you to open the cage. They know there's a world outside, cats to chase, dogs to irritate & a vast world to fly around. Freedom has a meaning to them.

Fish doesn't know or realize it.

<summary>Hooman companions</summary>

Of all the animals on Earth, there are only dogs and cats who we have the most companionship with. There are cows, goats too, but I mean organisms that is near to the size of a dog/cat. [Indian grey mongoose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_gray_mongoose) is cool, but they're very scared of humans. They stand up and stare at you, but I think they're cool. Snakes can't kill them, that's pretty savage.

A mother mongoose and their kids sometimes come in the backyard to find something to eat, but they're very scared of humans. They haven't developed the sound as cats do for begging, but they might in future, maybe. Were cats too savage like mongoose in the past ? Oh, [maybe](https://www.flickr.com/photos/damienbottura/2050971092/). Their cousin Tigers sure are !

Mongooses are not scared of snakes, but they're scared of humans. That tells someting eh ?

<summary>Cats have a sad life</summary>

Stray cats always come around during lunch times looking for something to eat. They literally beg with their sweet voices, trying to get some sympathy, with the hope that they'll get something to eat. Throughout their life, they need to beg to live. Have they survived in the world till now by beggging ?

Have begging turned out to be an innate part of their life ? The next generations will still beg, continuing what their forefathers did. Kittens grow up learning to be good beggars ? It has become intrinsic. That's sad.
