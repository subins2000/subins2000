I started programming out of curiosity when I was 11 years old (2011). My school syllabus (Kerala) was based on GNU/Linux. I was instantly curious seeing the terminal, wxGlade, IDLE, SuperTuxKart and other variety of apps that custom Ubuntu OS came with.

Then came the internet, I was fascinated with how I can chat with my cousins in another part of India through Facebook. I found out that Facebook was created in PHP, and then I went down that rabbit hole. Along my journey, I blogged my learnings at [subinsb.com](https://subinsb.com).

[Long story](https://subinsb.com/about/) short, I continued in web-dev for 14 years now. I grew up seeing the web moving from simple JS to minified JS to webpack to vite, haha.

In those 14 years, I've worked on many things: systems programming, Android, desktop apps, devops. But my main focus was always web-dev. Initially I was a PHP person, then Python, then Go and Ruby. One thing constant across all this is JavaScript :D
