I started programming when I was 11 years old (2011) out of curiosity using Linux and seeing Facebook/Orkut. I started with web-dev because I was fascinated with how I can chat with my cousins in another part of India through Facebook. I found out that Facebook was created in PHP, and then I went down that rabbit hole.

Long story short, I continued in web-dev for 14 years now. I grew up seeing the web moving from simple JS to minified JS to webpack to vite haha.

In those 14 years, I've worked on many things: systems programming, Android, desktop apps, but my main focus was always webdev. Initially I was a PHP person, then Python, then Ruby. One thing constant across all this is JavaScript :D
